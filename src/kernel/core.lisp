`name' is a string identifier for this kernel which is reported by
`print-object'. Worker threads will also be given this name, shown in
`bordeaux-threads:all-threads'.

`bindings' is an alist for establishing thread-local variables inside
worker threads. By default workers will have *standard-output* and
*error-output* bindings.

Dynamic context for each worker may be established with the function
`context'. The argument passed to `context' is a function which must
be funcalled. It begins the worker loop and will not return until the
worker exits. The default value of `context' is #'funcall. The special
variables in `bindings' are available inside the `context' function.

When a worker discovers that no tasks are available, `spin-count' is
the number of task-searching iterations done by the worker before
sleeping.

If `use-caller' is true (default is false) then in certain situations
the calling thread may be enlisted to steal work from worker threads.
This is an optimization strategy that currently applies only during
the execution of functions defined by `defpun' and `defpun/type'.
Typically in this case the number of workers will be one less than the
number of cores/CPUs.

A kernel will not be garbage collected until `end-kernel' is called."
